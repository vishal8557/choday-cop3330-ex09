/*Exercise 9 - Paint Calculator
        Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather than follow standard rounding rules.

        Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

        Example Output
        You will need to purchase 2 gallons of paint to cover 360 square feet.
        Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must
        round up to the next whole gallon.

        Constraints
        Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.

      Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.
